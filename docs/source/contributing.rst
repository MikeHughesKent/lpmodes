Contributions

Contributions to lpmodes or lpmodes_gui are very welcome via pull requests.

Changes should not change the output of existing API methods unless they are
physically incorrect or there is a strong reason for doing so, as you will break
other code.

All additions should be fully documented, both in the code and in the Sphinx 
documentation. Additional documentation of existing functions is also welcomed.

Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are currently a small number of tests in the test folder. After making 
any changes, ensure the unit tests still pass. If you have written new 
functions, please consider creating additional unit tests.
