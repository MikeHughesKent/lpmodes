lpmodes
====================================

The lpmodes package is a python toolkit designed for the analysis, simulation, 
and manipulation of linearly polarized (LP) modes in step index optical fibers.

Functions are provided to determine the allowed modes, compute their properties, 
and simulate coupling and propagation of beams.

A GUI, lpmodes_gui, allows modes to be solved, visualised and exported.
