Installation
---------------

Install the latest stable release from PyPI using::

    pip install lpmodes

Using pip install should find and install all the dependencies.  The dependencies
are all standard packages (matplotplib, numpy, scipy, PIL) which most users
will have already if you use an environment such as Anaconda. To run the GUI
you will also need PyQT5.

Note that the pip install doesn't include the examples and tests which still 
need to be `downloaded from Github <http://www.github.com/MikeHughesKent/lpmodes>`_.

Alternatively, you can manually download the source from Github, you will need to 
either manually check you have the requirements 
installed, or navigate to the lpmodes folder on your machine and run::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
to install the dependencies. You may wish to create a virtual environment 
using Conda/venv first to avoid conflicts with your existing python setup.
